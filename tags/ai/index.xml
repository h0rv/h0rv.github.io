This was my first and only Philosophy class I ever took. With that said, I really enjoyed the in-person discussions (that I was deprived of due to Covid-19 pandemic) and some of the readings. It was by far the most academic papers I had to read in a course (several weekly readings), which often resulted in having a strong urge to take a nap after 20 minutes of reading due to the density of the texts.</description></item></channel></rss>
