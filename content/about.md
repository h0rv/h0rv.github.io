**Hi, I'm Robby and welcome to my piece of the web!**

I am a software engineer, runner, and digital minimalist.

Here are some of the technologies I am interested in:

  - Open-source software (OSS)
  - AI
    - Large Language Models (LLMs) / Generative AI (GenAI)
    - AI Engineering
  - Infrastructure + Cloud
  - Distributed Systems
  - GNU/Linux
  - NeoVim
  - Privacy
  - Security
  - Compilers
    - Programming Language Design

Additionally, I care deeply about the effects that technologies have on society, in particular:
addictive technologies, AI, and the (near?) future with AGI.

I don't have social media anymore (except LinkedIn, unfortunately), but you can contact me at:
