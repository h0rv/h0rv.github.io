__Hi, I am Robby.__ Welcome to my website where I post my thoughts,
media I enjoyed, and other things no one will care about.

My technological interests include open-source, privacy, security, Linux, NeoVim, and systems.
More broadly, I am interested in technology's effects on society (probably social media),
running, and science-fiction.
