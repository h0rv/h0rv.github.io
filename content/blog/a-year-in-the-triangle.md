# A Year in the Triangle

  Upon my graduation of college, at 21 years old, I joined IBM Cloud full-time as a software engineer. The previous summer and fall I interned with the same team from the comfort of the basement in the home I grew up in.

  This time, on the other hand, I would be forced to join them in-person. This location, for me personally, was a long ways from home. I grew up in Pennsylvania and went to school on the opposite side of it, but never leaving it nonetheless. But now, I would have to move to Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.

  Also known commonly as Raleigh-Durham, Chapel Hill sometimes included in this metro, just RTP, and even the "Silicon Valley of the East Coast", according to my Dad. Honestly, I did not know the place even existed prior to my internship. I knew Duke and UNC, but wasn't really sure where they were in accordance to anything. Basically all I knew in North Carolina was the Outer Banks from when I was a child and Charlotte because of the Panthers - all else was a mystery.
