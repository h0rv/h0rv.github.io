**Hi, I'm Robby and welcome to my site!**

I am a software engineer, runner, reader, and digital minimalist.

Here are some of the technologies I am interested in:

  - Open-source software (OSS)
  - AI
    - Large Language Models (LLMs) / Generative AI (GenAI)
  - Cloud + Infrastructure
  - Distributed Systems
  - GNU/Linux
  - NeoVim
  - Privacy
  - Security
  - Compilers
    - Programming Language Design

Additionally, I care deeply about the effects that technologies have on society,
particularly: addictive technologies' impacts from both past and present, and AI's now and AGI's in the (near?) future.

I don't have social media anymore (except, unfortunately, LinkedIn), but you can contact me at:
