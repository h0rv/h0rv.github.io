&lt;p> Humans should not have access to virtually infinite streams of information.
Likewise, humans also should not smoke cigarettes or alcohol, but they have an individual choice (as they should) to make an educated decision to do so or not.
One difference, however, is that the latter products come with warning labels, while the former do not.
This is of great concern to me, due to the impact it had on me and the imagined impact I can see it having on the younger generation currently, when all the things I talk about are only amplified to the extreme.&lt;/p>
&lt;p> Downloading Instagram when I was in fifth grade seemed like a harmless act that everyone else was doing when it was new and exciting.
The only thing the app confirmed was if you were over the age of 13 (for data privacy laws), which as a clever 10-year-old, clicking the checkbox stated &amp;ldquo;Yes&amp;rdquo; was not too hard to bypass.
And with this sign-up, came a nearly decade-long drought of reading, and other forms of high-quality leisure activity, with an irreplaceable, yet much easier, the alternative of mindless scrolling and consuming low-quality forms of media.
During my extended usage of this app, and I would shamelessly say it was likely way over-usage, I came to a realization in my early undergraduate years that I had a problem.
This was the hardest and most consistently I was challenged academically, and as a result of this, I had to learn to actually study and focus.
Unsurprisingly, I struggled to focus immensely and was hit by this when I received a C or D on my first exam for multi-variable calculus in my first semester.
I always excelled at Math my whole life and never had to do any supplementary work to pass with 100s.
Admittedly, thinking college was going to be the same way was dumb, nonetheless, I had to start studying.
Long story short, I struggled to sit down and study and work deeply with my phone at the back of my mind at all times.
This is when I started to question my relationship with social media apps, and technology at large, which finally led up to, ending my second year of college, fully deleting all of my social media accounts, including Instagram and Facebook.
Instagram was my app of choice and could scroll for hours on the app.
I sound like the perfect &amp;ldquo;user&amp;rdquo; of the app for your monetization model of the app: collecting large amounts of ad revenue.
But at what cost? Not only was my ability to focus completely massacred from unhealthy usage of the app, but nearly 10 years of doing (literally) anything else was robbed of me.
I started reading more after abandoning social media.
Due to this, being robbed of 10 years worth of books where I could have gained vast amounts of knowledge or read something that had a profound impact at such a developmental stage of my life, is saddening.
Instead, I consumed low-quality media in mass abundance, and looking back, not a single one had even the slightest impact on my life.
In fact, there is not a particular post that I can even recall in general, or let alone say that it made me a better person in the slightest way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p> All this came with no warning labels.
And, from my knowledge, it still doesn&amp;rsquo;t.
So, on your products at Meta, I think it would be in everyone&amp;rsquo;s best interest if you would include warnings of the (high) potential things individuals will sacrifice by installing your apps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Go Fuck Yourself,&lt;/p>
&lt;p> Robby&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h1 id="background">Background&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>This was for an assignment for my &amp;ldquo;professional&amp;rdquo; writing course,
and, specifically, we had to do a complaint letter.
I was happy with the outcome and thought I would share.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Wireheads are Coming</title><link>https://h0rv.github.io/posts/wireheads-are-coming/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://h0rv.github.io/posts/wireheads-are-coming/</guid><description>The announcement of the Apple Vision Pro yesterday left me very conflicted. On one hand, the productivity gains that can be yielded by replacing the standard desk and monitor setups for myself and many others (and being able to easily travel with such large &amp;ldquo;screen space&amp;rdquo;) is very exciting. On the other, the dystopic future that was once predicted in 80&amp;rsquo;s science fiction is one step closer to becoming realized.</description><content>&lt;p>The announcement of the Apple Vision Pro yesterday left me very conflicted. On one hand, the productivity gains that can be yielded by replacing the standard desk and monitor setups for myself and many others (and being able to easily travel with such large &amp;ldquo;screen space&amp;rdquo;) is very exciting. On the other, the dystopic future that was once predicted in 80&amp;rsquo;s science fiction is one step closer to becoming realized.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Spatial computing does seem to be the future and has been a long time coming with virtual reality headsets, but now it seems all the technologies, both software, and hardware, are falling together to make such devices now possible. The current limitations of screens, especially on mobile computing, certainly limits the way we can interact with our devices. For example, I choose to use a tiling window manager to maximize screen size on my laptop. Is this the best way to interface with my computer? For a small screen space, I think yes, but in general? Likely not. This technology opens many doors to the future of computing and interfaces with the technologies we all use daily.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But I suppose this greatly depends on how one uses such technologies daily. If one interacts mostly with their small-sized smartphone, exploring the cesspool of what are the endless feeds of social media and entertainment apps like my current least favorite thing in the world, TikTok. The current use of these technologies, from my use of experiences and observations of others, is opening an app Instagram for a few swipes, swiping to Twitter, opening a Snapchat notification, responding to a friend or group chat, opening TikTok, getting bored, and repeat the cycle back on Instagram (or another most desired app). But great news, this wasted time flipping through apps can come to an end! With such new technologies, one can have a YouTube video playing, while having their Snapchat open, flipping through their friends&amp;rsquo; stories, texting in an iMessage group chat, all while scrolling for new crap they don&amp;rsquo;t need on Amazon. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t that sound wonderful?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Part of this truly scares me. I witness individuals scroll on TikTok, with their audio muted for extended periods. So, if an app like TikTok can be so addicting and stimulating on a small, 6-inch screen with, as seen, without audio not even necessary, how high is the ceiling of entrancement such apps can cast on their users with the levels of immersion spatial audio and video can give?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That is why I was always fascinated with the term &amp;ldquo;wirehead,&amp;rdquo; introduced to me by William Gibson in his Sprawl Trilogy. He used it to refer to individuals constantly &amp;ldquo;jacked-in&amp;rdquo; into cyberspace because whatever was in there, was &amp;ldquo;better&amp;rdquo;, at least in the current moment more entertaining or stimulating, than the life, &lt;em>their life&lt;/em>, right in front of them. I always thought it was funny due to how closely this resembles the masses&amp;rsquo; current use of smartphones, but now the actual wirehead is near.&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
