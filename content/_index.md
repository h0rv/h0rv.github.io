__Hi, I'm Robby and I am a software engineer__ â€“ and welcome to my website!

My technological interests include open-source, GNU/Linux, NeoVim, privacy, security,
compilers, language design, GenAI/LLMs, infrastructure, cloud, and systems.

More broadly, I am interested in technology's effects on society, digital minimalism,
productivity, and running.
