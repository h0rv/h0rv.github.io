__Hi, I'm Robby and I am a software engineer__ â€“ and welcome to my website!
Here I post my thoughts, media I enjoy, and other things no one will care about.

My technological interests include open-source, Linux, NeoVim, privacy, security,
compilers, language design, cloud, and systems.
More broadly, I am interested in technology's effects on society, digital minimalism,
productivity, and running.
