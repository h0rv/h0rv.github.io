This was my first and only Philosophy class I ever took. With that said, I really enjoyed the in-person discussions (that I was deprived of due to Covid-19 pandemic) and some of the readings. It was by far the most academic papers I had to read in a course (several weekly readings), which often resulted in having a strong urge to take a nap after 20 minutes of reading due to the density of the texts.</description></item><item><title>Wireheads are Coming</title><link>https://h0rv.github.io/posts/wireheads-are-coming/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://h0rv.github.io/posts/wireheads-are-coming/</guid><description>The announcement of the Apple Vision Pro yesterday left me very conflicted.

Humans should not have access to virtually infinite streams of information. Likewise, humans also should not smoke cigarettes or alcohol, but they have an individual choice (as they should) to make an educated decision to do so or not. One difference, however, is that the latter products come with warning labels, while the former do not. This is of great concern to me, due to the impact it had on me and the imagined impact I can see it having on the younger generation currently, when all the things I talk about are only amplified to the extreme.</description></item></channel></rss>
