  This is sort of a follow-up to my other post ["Digital Minimalism as a Software Engineer"](./digital-minimalism-as-a-software-engineer). I want to enumerate all the technology that I use regulary to keep productive, efficient, and fulfilled.

## Hardware

  I think it would be good to start with the physical devices that I use. First, and likely biggest, is smartphone. This has changed in the past few months, so here is a quick recap of the changes: 

  - Cracked Pixel 3(a?) which screen died due to sweat while running. I was going to describe this phone as "Old, cracked...", but stopped myself, but I do think it is interesting that I instinctively thought the device as "old", when it was released in 2018 and I got it in 2019. This just goes to show how as a society, but especially the younger generation, we do not value devices and technology after it ages a few years, despite being able to basically perform any action you would do on a new, cutting edge device. ("But TikTok in 90hz go brr" - somebody, probably).

  > Side story: my Pixel 3 died a day before a flight to NYC, which was an interesting experience and stressed out my girlfriend and mom by flying without a phone. It went very smooth though. I do admit was a little worried in case anything went wrong, but it goes to show that we are over-reliant on such devices, but thankfully the infrastructure is still there to navigate the world without non-smart devices: good old fashion physical boarding passes - until everything turns paper-less, oh no!

  - I then switched to an iPhone 12 mini, that I got via an upgrade a year or two earlier, which, at the time ended up with me switching back to the (RIP) Pixel 3. I don't like Apple, I resist being trapped in their ecosystem, iOS is bad and not customizable, the App Store is hell (impossible to find a non-stock weather app, or any app that does something trivial, that is not bombarded with apps), no adblocker support for browsers for when I need to use a web browser (but I typically like to keep disabled or blocked) on my phone. Despite those things, it is a great sized phone (nice and small) and iMessage is good because people use it. It is to no ones suprise that SMS still sucks, but I will for a day where most people use Signal or an app built on the Matrix protocol.

  - I perservered having to use an iPhone for a few months, and got a good deal on a Pixel 7a on black friday for Christmas. It is great, except for the size, but I opted to get a newer one for longer GrapheneOS support.
