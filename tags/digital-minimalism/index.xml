On one hand, the productivity gains that can be yielded by replacing the standard desk and monitor setups for myself and many others (and being able to easily travel with such large &amp;ldquo;screen space&amp;rdquo;) is very exciting.

Humans should not have access to virtually infinite streams of information. Likewise, humans also should not smoke cigarettes or alcohol, but they have an individual choice (as they should) to make an educated decision to do so or not. One difference, however, is that the latter products come with warning labels, while the former do not. This is of great concern to me, due to the impact it had on me and the imagined impact I can see it having on the younger generation currently, when all the things I talk about are only amplified to the extreme.</description></item></channel></rss>
