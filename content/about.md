**Hi, I am Robby!** I am a software engineer and digital minimalist.

I am passionate about open source, infrastructure, and AI.
Additionally, I care deeply about the effects that technologies have on society, in particular:
addictive technologies, detrimental consquences of centralization, and AI.

I don't have any socials but you can contact me at:
